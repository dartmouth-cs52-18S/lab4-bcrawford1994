I created a blogging platform to allow a user to upload posts that include pictures, tags and content. Additionally, the user can edit these blog posts or delete them altogether. I did this by implementing connected components for the list of all posts, individual posts, and a page to create a new post, in addition to a page to edit a post that is not a standalone component.

What worked was the utilization of actions and reducers to handle any changes of state for my 3 main components/containers.
